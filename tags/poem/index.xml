&amp;ldquo;One&amp;rsquo;s true character shows when the storm comes knocking, when they&amp;rsquo;re pressed to a wall, or caught by a trap. When plans fall through and dangers come to rest, the act falls away, the heart&amp;rsquo;s all that&amp;rsquo;s left.
We long for heroes in our life of normals. We yearn for the extraordinary to save us from quarrels.</description></item><item><title>53 - compliments</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</guid><description>rising lights shining
bright. reaching out beyond the
high, of second sky
that idea about compliments compliments are free energy i actually wrote about in a previous entry on kindness journals, which is wild because it means this experiment is proving its use by giving me a trail of my mental exploration.
This is the 53rd installment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.</description></item><item><title>46 - pitiful rage</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/pitiful-rage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/pitiful-rage/</guid><description/></item><item><title>39 - weary faces</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/weary-faces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/weary-faces/</guid><description/></item><item><title>the gaps</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/the-gaps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/the-gaps/</guid><description>thumping beats, reverberating ground a ritualized welcome or a dreadful threat to the entrants strangers and substances a perfect match for forgotten nights and regrettable fights the empty spaces of life those gaps in the space between the lived and the unlivable between the vocalized and the omitted water surges from within to fill those that make us ache with the rhythm of that fateful beat, that make us rage with the hot fury of those substancesâ€™ burn I reach out for the spaces yet they reach away an infinite chase, head after tail a still, pristine lake above a single drop triggers the climax below These gaps exist to be reached Yes, we live for reaching but oh!</description></item><item><title>a twinkle</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</guid><description>A shaft of moonlight pierces the curtain
In my concrete abode, a flare lighting the way out
The ephemeral promise draws me
like a firefly I seek my hopes.
The defeaning chorus of cicadas
consumes me in the darkness.
Out in the fields, the grains cultivated
What was promised eclipses the night
A permanent night light bathes me
as the swarm of stars engulfs me
from the infinite black canvas above</description></item></channel></rss>
