Press forward even as cloudy omens loom.
Have conviction especially as the arrows eclipse the sky.
When Danger approaches,
Wrap yourself in Conviction to
Ward away the evil.
Impish whispers urge quitting.
Steel your heart with your cowardiceâ€”
Fear: perfect for hardening resolve.
This is the 80th installment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.</description></item></channel></rss>
