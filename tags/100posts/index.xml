I honestly was doubting I&amp;rsquo;d make it this far when I got in about 30-40 because that in itself felt absurd to me. Now, it almost feels like double nature to try to flesh out an idea from a bullet into a whole mini-essay. Quantity hopefully is begetting quality.
Back from the tangent, today&amp;rsquo;s essay is about the Disney + Pixar movie Luca.</description></item><item><title>74 - bad vibes</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/bad-vibes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/bad-vibes/</guid><description>some notes on a realization on bad vibes today and how the opposite is like infinite energy:
seamless and fun collaboration can fuel you forever. my mantra is building cool shit with amazing people. that&amp;rsquo;s the dream
you can be a nice guy while not understanding the vibes some people are used to things going a certain way so they never encounter bad vibes because it&amp;rsquo;s a foreign concept to them (related piece on acclimating to power).</description></item><item><title>73 - pitter patter</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/pitter-patter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/pitter-patter/</guid><description>a couple poems on this rainy SF day.
pitter patter pitter patter
the droplets race
pitter patter
the ground laced
pitter patter
the humans hide
pitter patter
as the oceans stride
nothing to see tingling fingers,
pinching innards
disconnect feelings
and entangle urges
trying to run
begets walking;
trying to sing
begets croaking
willing to be
leaves nothing to see.
This is the 73rd installment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.</description></item><item><title>72 - soothing fire: a raging fire that cools</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/soothing-fire/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/soothing-fire/</guid><description>I met up with jonah today for dinner since he was visiting the city, and we atlked about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time on and the projects we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. Jonah&amp;rsquo;s been spending time working at Bubble as well as deeply exploring the crypto space: investing, developing, and now learning how to audit. One thing I really admire about him is that he goes all in on things. You can tell almost off the bat that there&amp;rsquo;s this inner fire burning in him that compels him to act and contribute and push forward for the things that he cares about.</description></item><item><title>71 - ablaze heart</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/ablaze-heart/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/ablaze-heart/</guid><description>Found some inspiring poetry lately so will be forcing myself to do more in the next couple weeks :)
&amp;ldquo;One&amp;rsquo;s true character shows
when the storm comes knocking,
when they&amp;rsquo;re pressed to a wall,
or caught by a trap.
When plans fall through
and dangers come to rest,
the act falls away,
the heart&amp;rsquo;s all that&amp;rsquo;s left.
We long for heroes
in our life of normals.
We yearn for the extraordinary</description></item><item><title>70 - taking what you want</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/taking-what-you-want/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/taking-what-you-want/</guid><description>I have a critical flaw (or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a strength). Despite the influence of substances, there&amp;rsquo;s a certain level of freewheeling behavior that I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to inhabit. It feels foreign, and I guess it is because I&amp;rsquo;ve never acted like that before.
In middle school, the dad of one of my basketball teammates promised me ice cream if i was able to get a foul in the last game of the season.</description></item><item><title>69 - power acclimation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/power-acclimation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/power-acclimation/</guid><description>I think people naturally acclimate to the mental state they put themselves in over and over and the environment they find themselves acting in day-to-day. It seeps in and takes over our default behavior without us realizing it. If you&amp;rsquo;re used to acquiescing in the face of conflict or running in the face of danger, you&amp;rsquo;re probably a push over. If you protect yourself from pain by pushing away all emotions, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably internalized that it&amp;rsquo;s better to feel nothing than to experience something bad.</description></item><item><title>68 - manifesting</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/manifesting/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/manifesting/</guid><description>trying on beliefs is a way to experiment with a different identity. I got this from the hot single nyc advice column for trying on the belief that you being with someone will be complementary. This is like what I was thinking with my thought experiments around turning around my hesitation towards action or anxiety around new situations. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been experiencing the same thing with my earrings—a bit of acting more confident and physically attractive than I felt like I was before?</description></item><item><title>67 - fast feedback loops and perils of convention</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/fast-feedback-loops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/fast-feedback-loops/</guid><description>I had today off too, so I spent the day eating burritos and making some updates to my personal website. I launched my fits stream the other day and started sharing it publicly while making some usability and performance improvements that this new project exposed. Few improvements included adding a permalink + a quick way to copy that link to clipboard since people were referencing their favorites by the #. On the performance side, I added lazy loading for the images and added some responsive image handling so that the content wasn&amp;rsquo;t reflowing every time a new image loaded.</description></item><item><title>66 - unstoppable expression</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/unstoppable-expression/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/unstoppable-expression/</guid><description>The few moments in my life where I&amp;rsquo;ve felt unstoppable have been seared into my memory because of how powerful I felt in those times. It&amp;rsquo;s the casual air of quiet confidence that I hangs around superheroes or very dedicated craftspeople. I find that the feeling is heavily tied to a skill or craft that you can feel ownership and proficiency in. The confidence is and limitless energy is a natural consequence of the captivation of your whole essence of being.</description></item><item><title>65 - simple things</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/simple-things/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/simple-things/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful day in SF, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting the chance to bike around the city again. I really just love this city for the simple things. For the blue skies and the cool breeze and the warm sun. For the red bridge and the evergreen grasses and the turquoise water. For those flaky croissants and also floofy dogs and the pockets of optimistic souls.
It&amp;rsquo;s so beautiful and perfect that it feels like I want to share it with someone.</description></item><item><title>64 - crazy ideas</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/crazy-ideas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/crazy-ideas/</guid><description>We had Coda&amp;rsquo;s Block Party today, which was a day-long event announcing a bunch of the huge features we&amp;rsquo;re launching soon and hosting many thought leaders to talk about their favorite &amp;ldquo;rituals,&amp;rdquo; repeated processes which keep you or your team productive and healthy. In the final fireside chat between Shishir, our CEO, and Reid Hoffman, a legend of venture investing, Shishir talked again about the initial meeting between them and how this idea seemed crazy at the time.</description></item><item><title>63 - radical migrations</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/radical-migrations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/radical-migrations/</guid><description>When you have something in the world that people are using, making changes becomes hard. With any moderately-sized codebase, a lot of software engineering becomes finding a good compromise with complexity—plugging in your change at the appropriate level of depth for the existing system, rather than making the perfect solution. It&amp;rsquo;s a job of politics: leaving most stakeholders unsatisfied but a little more satisfied than they were before. This can be a tough pill to swallow when you know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to populate a blank canvas with your brain child.</description></item><item><title>62 - intensity</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/intensity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/intensity/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to learn that I really like people who are intense and don&amp;rsquo;t compromise that intensity when it comes to anything that they do. I think intensity gets a bad rep. When I think about intensity, I think about someone rigid who can&amp;rsquo;t relax or adapt to new situations. Somehow I think we&amp;rsquo;ve been conditioned by society to think that these sorts of extreme feelings are bad or undesireable and to limit the amount of time we allow ourselves to feel those.</description></item><item><title>61 - opportunity</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/opportunity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/opportunity/</guid><description>I was talking with Ray today about how the biggest thing I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now is acting on instinct, doing before thinking, trusting myself to get through whatever path I choose in the moment rather than crafting the perfect response to my external stimuli. There&amp;rsquo;s a part of me deep down that fears failure in these situations, and the higher the stakes, the more I feel the pressure. Interpersonal situations are especially effective at generating anxiety and distrust.</description></item><item><title>60 - internet of empty promises</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/internet-of-empty-promises/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/internet-of-empty-promises/</guid><description>Thinking about link rot and ephemerality of the internet and how even things we have control of (our tools) experience this. We run from one shiny tool to the next and often, things don&amp;rsquo;t carry over or if they do import it&amp;rsquo;s not at full fidelity. Software promised us the permanence and stability that paper has never offered, but apps trapped our information in uncompromising and inflexible cages.
This is the 60th installment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.</description></item><item><title>59 - app paradox</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/app-paradox/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/app-paradox/</guid><description>Apps are where you interface with people in the digital world. Apps are the place that people are already at, the public places for gathering. To get the connection we&amp;rsquo;ve been blessed with from the internet, you&amp;rsquo;re forced to sign up and play by the rules of various third party app platforms. The good part is that you get to learn about friends and meet new people in these digital spaces.</description></item><item><title>58 - perception</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/perception/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/perception/</guid><description>People&amp;rsquo;s perception of you hinges so much based on your outer appearance. If you wear flamboyant clothes, you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;out there.&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;re wearing khakis and hiking boots, you really value comfort, and if you&amp;rsquo;re insistent on thin layers in freezing weather, you value fashion over comfort. These are all common stereotypes that people draw from a single glance, and it can take over your entire impression of a stranger. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this recently because I got my ears pierced yesterday and because of that, I feel like not only my friends but the strangers around me, even more so, are perceiving me differently.</description></item><item><title>57 - arc of the valley</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/arc-of-the-valley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/arc-of-the-valley/</guid><description>Arc of the valley from Rick, basically the hero&amp;rsquo;s journey but in silicon valley
Bright eyed on the ideals and optimism Disillusionment encountered at the dissonance Deep disillusionment, cynical about everything Matured state of making a difference where you can in your realm of control. Leaving the playground better than you found it The true cynicism comes from dealing with nasty people and artificial problems and finding out that a lot of the promises made around social good are empty.</description></item><item><title>56 - privilege of dreams</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/privilege-of-dreams/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/privilege-of-dreams/</guid><description>From a conversation with a friend:
i&amp;rsquo;m also sensing a strong the system is broken vibes around money and having privilege to follow your dreams.. the guy she&amp;rsquo;s casually seeing wants to be a full-time writer and has the monetary means to make it happen. The dynamic around privilege to chase your dreams and having to abide by capitalism can feel very overwhelming. I feel like a lot of people around my age are wrestling with the question of capitalism and what it makes us want to do.</description></item><item><title>55 - irreplaceable</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/irreplaceable/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/irreplaceable/</guid><description>Thinking about the fact that coda wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the same if a coworker didn&amp;rsquo;t join, which implies a level of irreplaceability. Being irreplaceable means your value is infinite in our world of supply and demand, as long as the demand is there for what you provide. But the simple fact of being irreplaceable doesn&amp;rsquo;t always coincide with what is needed in the moment or for the long-term. Being irreplaceable has a wide range of meaning.</description></item><item><title>54 - life is fragile</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/life-is-fragile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/life-is-fragile/</guid><description>Life is fragile is a message from Sex Education (fire tv show btw).
The main message is to live for the day because from the hour you’re born you begin to die. Another flavor of live to minimize regrets. We have such limited time on the planet. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste it on people or things that don&amp;rsquo;t make you happy or don&amp;rsquo;t care about you, and cherish the people and things who do because losing them will be incredibly hard.</description></item><item><title>53 - compliments</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</guid><description>rising lights shining

that idea about compliments compliments are free energy i actually wrote about in a previous entry on kindness journals, which is wild because it means this experiment is proving its use by giving me a trail of my mental exploration.

met betty and anton there and chatted them up a lot started because i gave compliment about the DIY jacket to betty, wild how a simple step can result in such a cool connection and conversation anton is super cool.

Reminded by how our smallest acts can make the biggest difference.
i&amp;rsquo;m doing &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things with friends but a lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s not actually in the moment fulfilling for me? like I only need these really stereotypically &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things in small dosages depending on my current mood. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m about to go to porter robinson&amp;rsquo;s second sky music festival, but I actually want to stay in and read about techno-optimism and exploring the relationship between software and people.</description></item><item><title>50 - formulation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/formulation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/formulation/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been really loving George Saunders recently, and I ran into this interview with him and now love him even more because of his perspective:
I don’t know that it [the ending] was the right one. But I think it was the most interesting one. That’s a funny thing about writing stories. We have that illusion that we are “deciding” what to make a character do, in order to “convey our message” or something like that.</description></item><item><title>49 - now's focus</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/nows-focus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/nows-focus/</guid><description>thinking for 100posts that I stop sending everyone an email all the time just send them weekly updates to be less?

discovered dk today who did a public journaling thing with Road to Ramen to document his journey to get enough money from the tools he made that he could survive on ramen.

You know those people who really know what they want and they go after it with everything they got and then they seize it and manifest it.

Mini-essays meaning they concisely demonstrate a single principle and are lightly edited (if at all).
My goal for them is to be a forcing function for me to distill the ideas with some substance that I think about each day into a publicly digestible form, but not edited or polished enough to become a full-blown blog post to retain some of that rawness and decrease the barrier to releasing it into the digital ether.</description></item></channel></rss>
