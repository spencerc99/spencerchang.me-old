You could tell they were coming using the large willows in our quiet neighborhood. The trick was when you saw the vibrancy start to fade from the canopy of leaves. People usually mistake it for when the leaves start to fall, but that isn’t a great sign since they start falling early. Once you got used to it, it was easy to notice the difference.</description></item><item><title>You and Them</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/you-and-them/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/you-and-them/</guid><description>Seattle Public Library (more here)
You grew up worrying about the best, fearing the worst, wondering what little thing would go wrong next, stomach curling over the fear and the anxiety that prowled just under the rush of everyday routine. You saw evidence, undeniable proof that the world was disappointed in you, there were people expecting to be let down, the people who didn’t think you could make it, to do what it is that you wanted to do, that you had to do, to be successful in a way that everyone could finally accept you for you.</description></item><item><title>a twinkle</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</guid><description>A shaft of moonlight pierces the curtain
In my concrete abode, a flare lighting the way out
The ephemeral promise draws me
like a firefly I seek my hopes.
The defeaning chorus of cicadas
consumes me in the darkness.
Out in the fields, the grains cultivated
What was promised eclipses the night
A permanent night light bathes me
as the swarm of stars engulfs me
from the infinite black canvas above</description></item></channel></rss>
