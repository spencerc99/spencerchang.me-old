I got this from the hot single nyc advice column for trying on the belief that you being with someone will be complementary. This is like what I was thinking with my thought experiments around turning around my hesitation towards action or anxiety around new situations. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been experiencing the same thing with my earrings‚Äîa bit of acting more confident and physically attractive than I felt like I was before?</description></item><item><title>67 - fast feedback loops and perils of convention</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/fast-feedback-loops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/fast-feedback-loops/</guid><description>I had today off too, so I spent the day eating burritos and making some updates to my personal website. I launched my fits stream the other day and started sharing it publicly while making some usability and performance improvements that this new project exposed. Few improvements included adding a permalink + a quick way to copy that link to clipboard since people were referencing their favorites by the #. On the performance side, I added lazy loading for the images and added some responsive image handling so that the content wasn&amp;rsquo;t reflowing every time a new image loaded.</description></item><item><title>66 - unstoppable expression</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/unstoppable-expression/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/unstoppable-expression/</guid><description>The few moments in my life where I&amp;rsquo;ve felt unstoppable have been seared into my memory because of how powerful I felt in those times. It&amp;rsquo;s the casual air of quiet confidence that I hangs around superheroes or very dedicated craftspeople. I find that the feeling is heavily tied to a skill or craft that you can feel ownership and proficiency in. The confidence is and limitless energy is a natural consequence of the captivation of your whole essence of being.</description></item><item><title>65 - simple things</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/simple-things/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/simple-things/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful day in SF, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting the chance to bike around the city again. I really just love this city for the simple things. For the blue skies and the cool breeze and the warm sun. For the red bridge and the evergreen grasses and the turquoise water. For those flaky croissants and also floofy dogs and the pockets of optimistic souls.
It&amp;rsquo;s so beautiful and perfect that it feels like I want to share it with someone.</description></item><item><title>64 - crazy ideas</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/crazy-ideas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/crazy-ideas/</guid><description>We had Coda&amp;rsquo;s Block Party today, which was a day-long event announcing a bunch of the huge features we&amp;rsquo;re launching soon and hosting many thought leaders to talk about their favorite &amp;ldquo;rituals,&amp;rdquo; repeated processes which keep you or your team productive and healthy. In the final fireside chat between Shishir, our CEO, and Reid Hoffman, a legend of venture investing, Shishir talked again about the initial meeting between them and how this idea seemed crazy at the time.</description></item><item><title>63 - radical migrations</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/radical-migrations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/radical-migrations/</guid><description>When you have something in the world that people are using, making changes becomes hard. With any moderately-sized codebase, a lot of software engineering becomes finding a good compromise with complexity‚Äîplugging in your change at the appropriate level of depth for the existing system, rather than making the perfect solution. It&amp;rsquo;s a job of politics: leaving most stakeholders unsatisfied but a little more satisfied than they were before. This can be a tough pill to swallow when you know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to populate a blank canvas with your brain child.</description></item><item><title>62 - intensity</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/intensity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/intensity/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to learn that I really like people who are intense and don&amp;rsquo;t compromise that intensity when it comes to anything that they do. I think intensity gets a bad rep. When I think about intensity, I think about someone rigid who can&amp;rsquo;t relax or adapt to new situations. Somehow I think we&amp;rsquo;ve been conditioned by society to think that these sorts of extreme feelings are bad or undesireable and to limit the amount of time we allow ourselves to feel those.</description></item><item><title>61 - opportunity</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/opportunity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/opportunity/</guid><description>I was talking with Ray today about how the biggest thing I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now is acting on instinct, doing before thinking, trusting myself to get through whatever path I choose in the moment rather than crafting the perfect response to my external stimuli. There&amp;rsquo;s a part of me deep down that fears failure in these situations, and the higher the stakes, the more I feel the pressure. Interpersonal situations are especially effective at generating anxiety and distrust.</description></item><item><title>60 - internet of empty promises</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/internet-of-empty-promises/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/internet-of-empty-promises/</guid><description>Thinking about link rot and ephemerality of the internet and how even things we have control of (our tools) experience this. We run from one shiny tool to the next and often, things don&amp;rsquo;t carry over or if they do import it&amp;rsquo;s not at full fidelity. Software promised us the permanence and stability that paper has never offered, but apps trapped our information in uncompromising and inflexible cages.

Apps are the place that people are already at, the public places for gathering. To get the connection we&amp;rsquo;ve been blessed with from the internet, you&amp;rsquo;re forced to sign up and play by the rules of various third party app platforms. The good part is that you get to learn about friends and meet new people in these digital spaces.</description></item><item><title>58 - perception</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/perception/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/perception/</guid><description>People&amp;rsquo;s perception of you hinges so much based on your outer appearance. If you wear flamboyant clothes, you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;out there.&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;re wearing khakis and hiking boots, you really value comfort, and if you&amp;rsquo;re insistent on thin layers in freezing weather, you value fashion over comfort. These are all common stereotypes that people draw from a single glance, and it can take over your entire impression of a stranger. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this recently because I got my ears pierced yesterday and because of that, I feel like not only my friends but the strangers around me, even more so, are perceiving me differently.</description></item><item><title>57 - arc of the valley</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/arc-of-the-valley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/arc-of-the-valley/</guid><description>Arc of the valley from Rick, basically the hero&amp;rsquo;s journey but in silicon valley
Bright eyed on the ideals and optimism Disillusionment encountered at the dissonance Deep disillusionment, cynical about everything Matured state of making a difference where you can in your realm of control. Leaving the playground better than you found it The true cynicism comes from dealing with nasty people and artificial problems and finding out that a lot of the promises made around social good are empty.</description></item><item><title>56 - privilege of dreams</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/privilege-of-dreams/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/privilege-of-dreams/</guid><description>From a conversation with a friend: i&amp;rsquo;m also sensing a strong the system is broken vibes around money and having privilege to follow your dreams.. the guy she&amp;rsquo;s casually seeing wants to be a full-time writer and has the monetary means to make it happen. The dynamic around privilege to chase your dreams and having to abide by capitalism can feel very overwhelming. I feel like a lot of people around my age are wrestling with the question of capitalism and what it makes us want to do.</description></item><item><title>55 - irreplaceable</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/irreplaceable/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/irreplaceable/</guid><description>Thinking about the fact that coda wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the same if a coworker didn&amp;rsquo;t join, which implies a level of irreplaceability. Being irreplaceable means your value is infinite in our world of supply and demand, as long as the demand is there for what you provide. But the simple fact of being irreplaceable doesn&amp;rsquo;t always coincide with what is needed in the moment or for the long-term. Being irreplaceable has a wide range of meaning.</description></item><item><title>54 - life is fragile</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/life-is-fragile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/life-is-fragile/</guid><description>Life is fragile is a message from Sex Education (fire tv show btw).
The main message is to live for the day because from the hour you‚Äôre born you begin to die. Another flavor of live to minimize regrets. We have such limited time on the planet. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste it on people or things that don&amp;rsquo;t make you happy or don&amp;rsquo;t care about you, and cherish the people and things who do because losing them will be incredibly hard.</description></item><item><title>53 - compliments</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</guid><description>rising lights shining

that idea about compliments compliments are free energy i actually wrote about in a previous entry on kindness journals, which is wild because it means this experiment is proving its use by giving me a trail of my mental exploration.
This is the 53rd installment in my experiment of publishing raw, lightly edited mini-essays every day towards achieving 100 public pieces.</description></item><item><title>52 - cafe encounter</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/cafe-encounter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/cafe-encounter/</guid><description>Talked to people at Stable Cafe today.
met betty and anton there and chatted them up a lot started because i gave compliment about the DIY jacket to betty, wild how a simple step can result in such a cool connection and conversation anton is super cool. STEAM education curriculum, spiral for french government and international school. Grew up on french island but is italian and was a robotics engineer.</description></item><item><title>51 - extraction and flower</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/extraction-and-flower/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/extraction-and-flower/</guid><description>at second sky, gave one of my flowers to a random guy who hit on me. Reminded by how our smallest acts can make the biggest difference.
i&amp;rsquo;m doing &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things with friends but a lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s not actually in the moment fulfilling for me? like I only need these really stereotypically &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things in small dosages depending on my current mood. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m about to go to porter robinson&amp;rsquo;s second sky music festival, but I actually want to stay in and read about techno-optimism and exploring the relationship between software and people.</description></item><item><title>50 - formulation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/formulation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/formulation/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been really loving George Saunders recently, and I ran into this interview with him and now love him even more because of his perspective:
I don‚Äôt know that it [the ending] was the right one. But I think it was the most interesting one. That‚Äôs a funny thing about writing stories. We have that illusion that we are ‚Äúdeciding‚Äù what to make a character do, in order to ‚Äúconvey our message‚Äù or something like that.</description></item><item><title>49 - now's focus</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/nows-focus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/nows-focus/</guid><description>thinking for 100posts that I stop sending everyone an email all the time just send them weekly updates to be less? Good opportunity for me to summarize how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling too and review my writing. start this week?
discovered dk today who did a public journaling thing with Road to Ramen to document his journey to get enough money from the tools he made that he could survive on ramen. This is sort of what I was aiming at with 100posts, but it keeps ending up feeling like more pressure since I&amp;rsquo;m notifying everyone on my list.</description></item><item><title>48 - singular purpose</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/singular-purpose/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/singular-purpose/</guid><description>when&amp;rsquo;s the last time I pursued something with singular purpose that wasn&amp;rsquo;t my career? You know those people who really know what they want and they go after it with everything they got and then they seize it and manifest it. I want to manifest the life that I want. manifest is a good theme for next year. What would I choose to pursue with a singular purpose right now? Is it being a good writer?</description></item></channel></rss>
