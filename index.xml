I got this from the hot single nyc advice column for trying on the belief that you being with someone will be complementary. This is like what I was thinking with my thought experiments around turning around my hesitation towards action or anxiety around new situations. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been experiencing the same thing with my earrings—a bit of acting more confident and physically attractive than I felt like I was before?</description></item><item><title>67 - fast feedback loops and perils of convention</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/fast-feedback-loops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/fast-feedback-loops/</guid><description>I had today off too, so I spent the day eating burritos and making some updates to my personal website. I launched my fits stream the other day and started sharing it publicly while making some usability and performance improvements that this new project exposed. Few improvements included adding a permalink + a quick way to copy that link to clipboard since people were referencing their favorites by the #. On the performance side, I added lazy loading for the images and added some responsive image handling so that the content wasn&amp;rsquo;t reflowing every time a new image loaded.</description></item><item><title>66 - unstoppable expression</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/unstoppable-expression/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/unstoppable-expression/</guid><description>The few moments in my life where I&amp;rsquo;ve felt unstoppable have been seared into my memory because of how powerful I felt in those times. It&amp;rsquo;s the casual air of quiet confidence that I hangs around superheroes or very dedicated craftspeople. I find that the feeling is heavily tied to a skill or craft that you can feel ownership and proficiency in. The confidence is and limitless energy is a natural consequence of the captivation of your whole essence of being.</description></item><item><title>65 - simple things</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/simple-things/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/simple-things/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful day in SF, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting the chance to bike around the city again. I really just love this city for the simple things. For the blue skies and the cool breeze and the warm sun. For the red bridge and the evergreen grasses and the turquoise water. For those flaky croissants and also floofy dogs and the pockets of optimistic souls.
It&amp;rsquo;s so beautiful and perfect that it feels like I want to share it with someone.</description></item><item><title>64 - crazy ideas</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/crazy-ideas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/crazy-ideas/</guid><description>We had Coda&amp;rsquo;s Block Party today, which was a day-long event announcing a bunch of the huge features we&amp;rsquo;re launching soon and hosting many thought leaders to talk about their favorite &amp;ldquo;rituals,&amp;rdquo; repeated processes which keep you or your team productive and healthy. In the final fireside chat between Shishir, our CEO, and Reid Hoffman, a legend of venture investing, Shishir talked again about the initial meeting between them and how this idea seemed crazy at the time.</description></item><item><title>63 - radical migrations</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/radical-migrations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/radical-migrations/</guid><description>When you have something in the world that people are using, making changes becomes hard. With any moderately-sized codebase, a lot of software engineering becomes finding a good compromise with complexity—plugging in your change at the appropriate level of depth for the existing system, rather than making the perfect solution. It&amp;rsquo;s a job of politics: leaving most stakeholders unsatisfied but a little more satisfied than they were before. This can be a tough pill to swallow when you know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to populate a blank canvas with your brain child.</description></item><item><title>re: take back the future - the magic is ours</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/take-back-the-future-response/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/take-back-the-future-response/</guid><description>In response to take back the future
In high school, I took a computer science class because I liked to play computer games. I never intended for it to become an outlet for expression, a STEM safe haven for my creative urges. I fell for the craft as much as I fell for the people and brands that were the face of it in society.
I&amp;rsquo;m heavily drawn to ideals, so nothing drew me more than the shining G, which had started to become the face of everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience with the internet.</description></item><item><title>62 - intensity</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/intensity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/intensity/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting to learn that I really like people who are intense and don&amp;rsquo;t compromise that intensity when it comes to anything that they do. I think intensity gets a bad rep. When I think about intensity, I think about someone rigid who can&amp;rsquo;t relax or adapt to new situations. Somehow I think we&amp;rsquo;ve been conditioned by society to think that these sorts of extreme feelings are bad or undesireable and to limit the amount of time we allow ourselves to feel those.</description></item><item><title>61 - opportunity</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/opportunity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/opportunity/</guid><description>I was talking with Ray today about how the biggest thing I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now is acting on instinct, doing before thinking, trusting myself to get through whatever path I choose in the moment rather than crafting the perfect response to my external stimuli. There&amp;rsquo;s a part of me deep down that fears failure in these situations, and the higher the stakes, the more I feel the pressure. Interpersonal situations are especially effective at generating anxiety and distrust.</description></item><item><title>60 - internet of empty promises</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/internet-of-empty-promises/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/internet-of-empty-promises/</guid><description>Thinking about link rot and ephemerality of the internet and how even things we have control of (our tools) experience this. We run from one shiny tool to the next and often, things don&amp;rsquo;t carry over or if they do import it&amp;rsquo;s not at full fidelity. Software promised us the permanence and stability that paper has never offered, but apps trapped our information in uncompromising and inflexible cages.

Apps are the place that people are already at, the public places for gathering. To get the connection we&amp;rsquo;ve been blessed with from the internet, you&amp;rsquo;re forced to sign up and play by the rules of various third party app platforms. The good part is that you get to learn about friends and meet new people in these digital spaces.</description></item><item><title>58 - perception</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/perception/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/perception/</guid><description>People&amp;rsquo;s perception of you hinges so much based on your outer appearance. If you wear flamboyant clothes, you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;out there.&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;re wearing khakis and hiking boots, you really value comfort, and if you&amp;rsquo;re insistent on thin layers in freezing weather, you value fashion over comfort. These are all common stereotypes that people draw from a single glance, and it can take over your entire impression of a stranger. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this recently because I got my ears pierced yesterday and because of that, I feel like not only my friends but the strangers around me, even more so, are perceiving me differently.</description></item><item><title>57 - arc of the valley</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/arc-of-the-valley/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/arc-of-the-valley/</guid><description>Arc of the valley from Rick, basically the hero&amp;rsquo;s journey but in silicon valley
Bright eyed on the ideals and optimism Disillusionment encountered at the dissonance Deep disillusionment, cynical about everything Matured state of making a difference where you can in your realm of control. Leaving the playground better than you found it The true cynicism comes from dealing with nasty people and artificial problems and finding out that a lot of the promises made around social good are empty.</description></item><item><title>56 - privilege of dreams</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/privilege-of-dreams/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/privilege-of-dreams/</guid><description>From a conversation with a friend: i&amp;rsquo;m also sensing a strong the system is broken vibes around money and having privilege to follow your dreams.. the guy she&amp;rsquo;s casually seeing wants to be a full-time writer and has the monetary means to make it happen. The dynamic around privilege to chase your dreams and having to abide by capitalism can feel very overwhelming. I feel like a lot of people around my age are wrestling with the question of capitalism and what it makes us want to do.</description></item><item><title>55 - irreplaceable</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/irreplaceable/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/irreplaceable/</guid><description>Thinking about the fact that coda wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the same if a coworker didn&amp;rsquo;t join, which implies a level of irreplaceability. Being irreplaceable means your value is infinite in our world of supply and demand, as long as the demand is there for what you provide. But the simple fact of being irreplaceable doesn&amp;rsquo;t always coincide with what is needed in the moment or for the long-term. Being irreplaceable has a wide range of meaning.</description></item><item><title>54 - life is fragile</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/life-is-fragile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/life-is-fragile/</guid><description>Life is fragile is a message from Sex Education (fire tv show btw).
The main message is to live for the day because from the hour you’re born you begin to die. Another flavor of live to minimize regrets. We have such limited time on the planet. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste it on people or things that don&amp;rsquo;t make you happy or don&amp;rsquo;t care about you, and cherish the people and things who do because losing them will be incredibly hard.</description></item><item><title>53 - compliments</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/compliments/</guid><description>rising lights shining

that idea about compliments compliments are free energy i actually wrote about in a previous entry on kindness journals, which is wild because it means this experiment is proving its use by giving me a trail of my mental exploration.

i&amp;rsquo;m doing &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things with friends but a lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s not actually in the moment fulfilling for me? like I only need these really stereotypically &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things in small dosages depending on my current mood. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m about to go to porter robinson&amp;rsquo;s second sky music festival, but I actually want to stay in and read about techno-optimism and exploring the relationship between software and people.</description></item><item><title>50 - formulation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/formulation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/formulation/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been really loving George Saunders recently, and I ran into this interview with him and now love him even more because of his perspective:
I don’t know that it [the ending] was the right one. But I think it was the most interesting one. That’s a funny thing about writing stories. We have that illusion that we are “deciding” what to make a character do, in order to “convey our message” or something like that.</description></item><item><title>49 - now's focus</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/nows-focus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/nows-focus/</guid><description>thinking for 100posts that I stop sending everyone an email all the time just send them weekly updates to be less?

Liminality is defined as the quality of transition between one destination and the next. It’s a state of being that feels unnatural because it’s meant to be temporary. Liminal states and places are defined only by their beginning and end—they have no meaning in absence of their composite destinations.</description></item><item><title>43 - kindness journal</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/kindness-journal/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/kindness-journal/</guid><description/></item><item><title>42 - fake money</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/fake-money/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/fake-money/</guid><description/></item><item><title>41 - decisiveness</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/decisiveness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/decisiveness/</guid><description/></item><item><title>40 - blazing lights</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/blazing-lights/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/blazing-lights/</guid><description/></item><item><title>38 - digital capitalism</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/digital-capitalism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/digital-capitalism/</guid><description/></item><item><title>39 - weary faces</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/weary-faces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/weary-faces/</guid><description/></item><item><title>37 - personal panopticon</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/personal-panopticon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/personal-panopticon/</guid><description/></item><item><title>36 - empty mind</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/empty-mind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/empty-mind/</guid><description/></item><item><title>35 - repetition</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/repetition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/repetition/</guid><description/></item><item><title>34 - denim personality</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/denim-personality/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/denim-personality/</guid><description/></item><item><title>33 - the same thing</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-same-thing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-same-thing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>32 - chasing stability</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/chasing-stability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/chasing-stability/</guid><description/></item><item><title>31 - the technology paradox</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-technology-paradox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-technology-paradox/</guid><description/></item><item><title>the technology paradox</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/technology-paradox/</guid><description>Under 280 in San Francisco during golden hour.
Yesterday, I made the trek down to Palo Alto for Alex&amp;rsquo;s birthday and had a great time in the afternoon barbecuing, laughing, and enjoying the South Bay summer. I was realizing it was the first time in the Bay where I&amp;rsquo;ve attended a large gathering that wasn&amp;rsquo;t predominantly people in the tech industry. Alex is a graduate student in physics at Stanford, so the party was full of PhD candidates and high school friends who&amp;rsquo;ve covered a spread across the different fields.</description></item><item><title>30 - the gaps</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-gaps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-gaps/</guid><description/></item><item><title>the gaps</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/the-gaps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/the-gaps/</guid><description>thumping beats, reverberating ground a ritualized welcome or a dreadful threat to the entrants strangers and substances a perfect match for forgotten nights and regrettable fights the empty spaces of life those gaps in the space between the lived and the unlivable between the vocalized and the omitted water surges from within to fill those that make us ache with the rhythm of that fateful beat, that make us rage with the hot fury of those substances’ burn I reach out for the spaces yet they reach away an infinite chase, head after tail a still, pristine lake above a single drop triggers the climax below These gaps exist to be reached Yes, we live for reaching but oh!</description></item><item><title>29 - uneven time</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/uneven-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/uneven-time/</guid><description/></item><item><title>28 - a drop of color</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/a-drop-of-color/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/a-drop-of-color/</guid><description/></item><item><title>27 - home and fake nostalgia</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/home-and-fake-nostalgia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/home-and-fake-nostalgia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>26 - do more, be more</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/do-more-be-more/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/do-more-be-more/</guid><description/></item><item><title>25 - silent conversations</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/silent-conversations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/silent-conversations/</guid><description/></item><item><title>24 - dauntlessness</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/dauntlessness/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/dauntlessness/</guid><description/></item><item><title>23 - trust</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/trust/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/trust/</guid><description/></item><item><title>22 - reflection systems</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/reflection-systems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/reflection-systems/</guid><description/></item><item><title>21 - aperture of life</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/aperture-of-life/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/aperture-of-life/</guid><description/></item><item><title>20 - i can only get smarter by being dumb and other advice to myself</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/i-can-only-get-smarter-by-being-dumb-and-other-advice-to-myself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/i-can-only-get-smarter-by-being-dumb-and-other-advice-to-myself/</guid><description/></item><item><title>19 - the silo culture</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-silo-culture/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-silo-culture/</guid><description/></item><item><title>18 - commitment and obligation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/commitment-and-obligation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/commitment-and-obligation/</guid><description/></item><item><title>commitment and obligation</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/commitment-and-obligation/</guid><description>The first time I ran 3 miles was during a typical Houston summer, hot and humid.

It’s a message from a classmate asking about my rooming plans for next semester with a not-so-subtle suggestion at a better option. I’m nearing the end of my first year in college, and having been successful at my quest to fit in, I’m tempted to change as little as possible to keep the good things going. The proposal to room with someone new (who I knew from the very intimate experience of recognizing their face across the dining hall every once in a while) was both an opportunity and a risk.</description></item><item><title>diluted stars, islands, civic tech, and 🍜</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/diluted-stars-islands-civic-tech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/diluted-stars-islands-civic-tech/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dilution</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/dilution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/dilution/</guid><description>Under my watchful eyes, a weight settles over the world. Thick layers of shadows pile on top of one another until all that’s left poking out in the sea of night are tiny fireflies, little torches signaling life. I look out my golden-ratioed window, a precise, technical masterpiece with a reinforced panel of glass acting as a projector for the production playing out beyond. In the distant horizon, the line where the sky meets the world and the galactic bend, glinting ever so inconspicuously, levels with my eyes.</description></item><item><title>Making the World a Better Place: A Valley of Smoke and Mirrors</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</guid><description>a beach along Route 1 covered by the fog (photo credit spencerchang.photography)
To communicate an identity requires some degree of self-delusion. A performer, in order to be convincing, must conceal “the discreditable facts that he has had to learn about the performance; in everyday terms, there will be things he knows, or has known, that he will not be able to tell himself.” ーTrick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino summarizing Erving Goffman</description></item><item><title>Making the “Right” Decisions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</guid><description>A mother and cub flourishing in the remains of a whaling station in Grytviken&amp;ndash;an example of something &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; becoming wrong.

Growing up, I strove to do all the “right” things. I was told that doing well in school was good, so I studied, toiled, and recited for good grades. I was told that being polite and obedient was proper, so I sucked up my protests and did what was demanded of me without question.</description></item><item><title>George Floyd</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/george-floyd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/george-floyd/</guid><description>SF George Floyd Protest 06/03 for more see my instagram This week should have felt like another rude awakening for those of us who have rarely had to think about the problems in our criminal justice system and how our country handles protecting our communities.</description></item><item><title>Broken Lines</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/broken-lines/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/broken-lines/</guid><description>a stack of logs on a Napa trip (for more photos)
But in a life of activity, one free from dramatic rupture, where the progress of things is unbroken by catastrophe, where the skin of our thoughts is regularly touched by new impressions, discoveries and influences, our maturation comes to follow a gradient that creates the illusion of a seamless line. With Uncle Hmad, the young man he was at the point of his arrest and the man he has become seemed to exist in parallel, destined never to meet and yet resonating against one another like two discordant musical notes.</description></item><item><title>a twinkle</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</guid><description>A shaft of moonlight pierces the curtain
In my concrete abode, a flare lighting the way out
The ephemeral promise draws me
like a firefly I seek my hopes.
The defeaning chorus of cicadas
consumes me in the darkness.
Out in the fields, the grains cultivated
What was promised eclipses the night
A permanent night light bathes me
as the swarm of stars engulfs me

We had just gotten back from the movies, and I was going through the regular ritual of preparing for my nightly recharge. The room was pitch dark except for the flickering amalgam of multicolored lights dancing across the window: reflections mirroring the revelry of a city alive at night.
As I was finishing my movements in robotic silence, an irregular symphony of beats stirred me from my semi-wakeful, semi-listless state.</description></item><item><title>Rice Fields and Murky Identities</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/rice-fields/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/rice-fields/</guid><description>Rice fields right outside 宜梧 (YiWu) Junior High School during sunset (taken on my Nikon D3400)
“来吃饭了！(literally, &amp;lsquo;come eat!&amp;rsquo; but interpreted as &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo;s ready!&amp;rsquo; )” rang through the hallways of my house, emanating from the kitchen. This was a daily occurrence, after a long day of school or work, signaling that dinner, which my 奶奶 (grandma) had lovingly prepared, was ready. Growing up in a Chinese American household, I was lucky to have my grandma live with us; this forced me to learn Mandarin from a young age because she couldn’t speak English.</description></item><item><title>From Student to Teacher</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/student-to-teacher/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/student-to-teacher/</guid><description>Photo by Mwesigwa Joel on Unsplash
”誰是我們的老師啊？(Who are our teachers?)“
“是我們 (We are)” I blurted.
Shit. We had just finished a whole week of training where we were specifically told to pretend not to know Chinese to encourage our students to speak English. And I had just responded in Chinese to their question. Great, first minute of “teaching” and I already messed up.

The mere prospect of a roller coaster ride had reduced me to a broken record. I’ve never been a follower of the camp that derives thrill, much less joy, from artificial fear. Horror movies are a hard no, especially at night, alone in my room, and maybe it’s obvious, but I had never ridden a roller coaster.</description></item><item><title>Scaling Knowledge Access and Retrieval at Airbnb</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/knowledge-graph/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/knowledge-graph/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
