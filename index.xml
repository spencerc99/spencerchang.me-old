You could tell they were coming using the large willows in our quiet neighborhood. The trick was when you saw the vibrancy start to fade from the canopy of leaves. People usually mistake it for when the leaves start to fall, but that isn’t a great sign since they start falling early. Once you got used to it, it was easy to notice the difference.</description></item><item><title>12 - slow burn</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/slow-burn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/slow-burn/</guid><description/></item><item><title>11 - realizing an idea</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/realizing-an-idea/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/realizing-an-idea/</guid><description/></item><item><title>10 - dampening of curiosity</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/dampening-of-curiosity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/dampening-of-curiosity/</guid><description/></item><item><title>9 - dancing through life</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/dancing-through-life/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/dancing-through-life/</guid><description/></item><item><title>8 - craft over career</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/craft-over-career/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/craft-over-career/</guid><description/></item><item><title>7 - zoom fatigue and low pressure contexts</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/low-pressure-contexts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/low-pressure-contexts/</guid><description/></item><item><title>6 - shaping the world</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/shaping-the-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/shaping-the-world/</guid><description/></item><item><title>5 - why do uncomfortable chairs exist?</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/uncomfortable-chairs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/uncomfortable-chairs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>4 - samishii and nostalgia</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/samishii-and-nostalgia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/samishii-and-nostalgia/</guid><description/></item><item><title>3 - the superpower of naming</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-superpower-of-naming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-superpower-of-naming/</guid><description/></item><item><title>2 - vibe tribes and finding psychological oxygen</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/vibe-tribes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/vibe-tribes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>1 - the mid twenties</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-mid-twenties/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/the-mid-twenties/</guid><description/></item><item><title>towards 2021</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/towards-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/towards-2021/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gambling on Dreams</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/gambling/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/gambling/</guid><description>A vibration ripples out from my phone. It’s a message from a classmate asking about my rooming plans for next semester with a not-so-subtle suggestion at a better option. I’m nearing the end of my first year in college, and having been successful at my quest to fit in, I’m tempted to change as little as possible to keep the good things going. The proposal to room with someone new (who I knew from the very intimate experience of recognizing their face across the dining hall every once in a while) was both an opportunity and a risk.</description></item><item><title>diluted stars, islands, civic tech, and 🍜</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/diluted-stars-islands-civic-tech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/newsletter/diluted-stars-islands-civic-tech/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dilution</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/dilution/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/dilution/</guid><description>Under my watchful eyes, a weight settles over the world. Thick layers of shadows pile on top of one another until all that’s left poking out in the sea of night are tiny fireflies, little torches signaling life. I look out my golden-ratioed window, a precise, technical masterpiece with a reinforced panel of glass acting as a projector for the production playing out beyond. In the distant horizon, the line where the sky meets the world and the galactic bend, glinting ever so inconspicuously, levels with my eyes.</description></item><item><title>Making the World a Better Place: A Valley of Smoke and Mirrors</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/better-world-delusion/</guid><description>a beach along Route 1 covered by the fog (photo credit spencerchang.photography)
To communicate an identity requires some degree of self-delusion. A performer, in order to be convincing, must conceal “the discreditable facts that he has had to learn about the performance; in everyday terms, there will be things he knows, or has known, that he will not be able to tell himself.” ーTrick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion by Jia Tolentino summarizing Erving Goffman</description></item><item><title>Making the “Right” Decisions</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/right-decisions/</guid><description>A mother and cub flourishing in the remains of a whaling station in Grytviken&amp;ndash;an example of something &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; becoming wrong.

Growing up, I strove to do all the “right” things. I was told that doing well in school was good, so I studied, toiled, and recited for good grades. I was told that being polite and obedient was proper, so I sucked up my protests and did what was demanded of me without question.</description></item><item><title>George Floyd</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/george-floyd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/george-floyd/</guid><description>SF George Floyd Protest 06/03 for more see my instagram This week should have felt like another rude awakening for those of us who have rarely had to think about the problems in our criminal justice system and how our country handles protecting our communities.</description></item><item><title>Broken Lines</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/broken-lines/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/broken-lines/</guid><description>a stack of logs on a Napa trip (for more photos)
But in a life of activity, one free from dramatic rupture, where the progress of things is unbroken by catastrophe, where the skin of our thoughts is regularly touched by new impressions, discoveries and influences, our maturation comes to follow a gradient that creates the illusion of a seamless line. With Uncle Hmad, the young man he was at the point of his arrest and the man he has become seemed to exist in parallel, destined never to meet and yet resonating against one another like two discordant musical notes.</description></item><item><title>a twinkle</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/a-twinkle/</guid><description>A shaft of moonlight pierces the curtain
In my concrete abode, a flare lighting the way out
The ephemeral promise draws me
like a firefly I seek my hopes.
The defeaning chorus of cicadas
consumes me in the darkness.
Out in the fields, the grains cultivated
What was promised eclipses the night
A permanent night light bathes me
as the swarm of stars engulfs me
from the infinite black canvas above</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourced Birthday Recommendations</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/crowdsourced-birthday-recs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/crowdsourced-birthday-recs/</guid><description>I collected anonymous (or not) birthday recommendations and feedback.

It all started in a bright hospital room in downtown Houston&amp;hellip;
Ok maybe not that far back, but essentially I got the idea from my friend Kevin Lau who did the same thing for his birthday.</description></item><item><title>The War of Intentions and Beliefs</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/war-of-intentions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/war-of-intentions/</guid><description>What happens when good intentions are lost, everyone wants to be a hero, and the fight against evil spills over into innocents.</description></item><item><title>Decoding your Mind</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/decoding-your-mind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/decoding-your-mind/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Discovering a New Year</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/discovering/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/discovering/</guid><description>Exploration—the relinquishing of the old for something new and unknown.

We had just gotten back from the movies, and I was going through the regular ritual of preparing for my nightly recharge. The room was pitch dark except for the flickering amalgam of multicolored lights dancing across the window: reflections mirroring the revelry of a city alive at night.
As I was finishing my movements in robotic silence, an irregular symphony of beats stirred me from my semi-wakeful, semi-listless state.</description></item><item><title>Rice Fields and Murky Identities</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/rice-fields/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/rice-fields/</guid><description>Rice fields right outside 宜梧 (YiWu) Junior High School during sunset (taken on my Nikon D3400)
“来吃饭了！(literally, &amp;lsquo;come eat!&amp;rsquo; but interpreted as &amp;lsquo;food&amp;rsquo;s ready!&amp;rsquo; )” rang through the hallways of my house, emanating from the kitchen. This was a daily occurrence, after a long day of school or work, signaling that dinner, which my 奶奶 (grandma) had lovingly prepared, was ready. Growing up in a Chinese American household, I was lucky to have my grandma live with us; this forced me to learn Mandarin from a young age because she couldn’t speak English.</description></item><item><title>From Student to Teacher</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/student-to-teacher/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/student-to-teacher/</guid><description>Photo by Mwesigwa Joel on Unsplash
”誰是我們的老師啊？(Who are our teachers?)“
“是我們 (We are)” I blurted.
Shit. We had just finished a whole week of training where we were specifically told to pretend not to know Chinese to encourage our students to speak English. And I had just responded in Chinese to their question. Great, first minute of “teaching” and I already messed up. How am I gonna survive 2 weeks of this?</description></item><item><title>Stupid Scholars, the Power of Hands, and Free Lunches: Riding Through 4 Years of University</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/stupid-scholars/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/stupid-scholars/</guid><description>“It’ll be fine,” I reassured myself for what seemed like the millionth time. The mere prospect of a roller coaster ride had reduced me to a broken record. I’ve never been a follower of the camp that derives thrill, much less joy, from artificial fear. Horror movies are a hard no, especially at night, alone in my room, and maybe it’s obvious, but I had never ridden a roller coaster.</description></item><item><title>Scaling Knowledge Access and Retrieval at Airbnb</title><link>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/knowledge-graph/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.spencerchang.me/posts/knowledge-graph/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
